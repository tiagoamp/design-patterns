# Design Patterns
Design Patterns implementations

## Creational Design Patterns
1. __Singleton__ (restricts object creation for a class to only one instance)
1. __Factory__ Method (creates objects without specifying the exact class to create)
1. __Abstract__ Factory (groups object factories that have a common theme)
1. __Builder__ (constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation)
1. __Prototype__ (creates objects by cloning an existing object)

## Behavioral Design Patterns
1. __Strategy__ (allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime)
1. __Observer__ (is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event)
1. __Template__ Method (defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior)
1. __State__ (allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes)

## Structural Design Patterns
1. __Adapter__ (allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class)
1. __Bridge__ (decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently)
1. __Proxy__ (provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity)
1. __Decorator__ (dynamically adds/overrides behaviour in an existing method of an object)
1. __Composite__ (composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object)
1. __Facade__ (provides a simplified interface to a large body of code)
