Design Patterns implementations

## Creational Design Patterns
1. __Singleton__ (restricts object creation for a class to only one instance)
1. __Factory__ Method (creates objects without specifying the exact class to create)
1. __Abstract__ Factory (groups object factories that have a common theme)
1. __Builder__ (constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation)
1. __Prototype__ (creates objects by cloning an existing object)

## Behavioral Design Patterns
1. Strategy (allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime)
1. Observer (is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event)
1. Template Method (defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior)
1. State (allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes)

## Structural Design Patterns
1. Adapter (allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class)
1. Bridge (decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently)
1. Proxy (provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity)
1. Decorator (dynamically adds/overrides behaviour in an existing method of an object)
1. Composite (composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object)
1. Facade (provides a simplified interface to a large body of code)
