Design Patterns implementations

## Creational Design Patterns
1. Singleton (restricts object creation for a class to only one instance)
1. Factory Method (creates objects without specifying the exact class to create)
1. Abstract Factory (groups object factories that have a common theme)
1. Builder (constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation)
1. Prototype (creates objects by cloning an existing object)

## Behavioral Design Patterns
1. Strategy (allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime)
1. Observer (is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event)
1. Template Method
1. State

## Structural Design Patterns
1. Adapter
1. Bridge
